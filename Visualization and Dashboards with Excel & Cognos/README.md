<h1>Assignment 1 Scenario</h1>
<p>As a regional manager for a chain of car dealerships you need to create some visualizations to allow you to understand your car sales and profits for each dealer.

  <h3>Guidelines for the Submission</h3>
Download the file CarSalesByModelStart.xlsx. Upload and open the file in Excel for the web.

<h3> Tasks to perform:</h3>
Create visualizations for the following captured KPI metrics:

<br>'Quantity Sold' by 'Dealer ID' - as a bar chart, sorted in either ascending or descending order of quantity sold, and change the chart title to "Quantity Sold by
Dealer ID" (Hint: Use the pivot table on Sheet1, and use 'Format' on the 'Chart' tab to change the chart title) </br>
<br>'Profit' by 'Date' and 'Model' - as a line chart, and give the chart a title of "Profit by Date and Model" (Hint: Use the pivot table on Sheet2, and use 'Chart
Title' on the 'Chart' tab to change the chart title)</br>
<br>'Profit' by 'Year' and 'Dealer ID' - as a column chart, titled "Profit by Year and Dealer ID" with the data columns in red (Hint: Use the pivot table on Sheet3, and
use 'Format' on the 'Chart' tab to change the chart title and to format the 'series' fill color in red)</br>
<br>'Sum of Profits' for 'Hudson model cars' by 'Dealer ID' - as a line chart, titled "Profit of Hudson Models by Dealer ID". Also remove the horizontal gridlines from
the chart, put the legend on the right side of the chart, and color the series outline in green. (Hint: Use the pivot table on Sheet4, use 'Gridlines' in the 'Axes'
group on the 'Chart' tab to remove the gridlines, and use 'Format' on the 'Chart' tab to change the chart title, to move the legend, and to format the 'series' outline
color in green)</br>
<br>Save your workbook: Use 'Save As' to save your completed workbook as CarSalesByModelEnd.xlsx</br>
